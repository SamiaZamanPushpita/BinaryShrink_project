# BinaryShrink
Lossless File Compression Tool  
Operating Systems Design Project (CSE323.14)

## Project Overview
BinaryShrink is a browser-based lossless file compression and decompression tool
developed to demonstrate Operating Systems concepts such as file input/output,
binary data handling, metadata management, and storage optimization.

The project supports two compression algorithms:
- Huffman Coding
- Run Length Encoding (RLE)

## Features
- Compress and decompress files with no data loss
- Custom compressed file format (.bzc)
- Automatic algorithm detection during decompression
- Displays original size, compressed size, and compression ratio
- Fully client-side (no server required)

## Operating Systems Concepts Applied
- File input/output operations
- Binary data representation
- Metadata management
- Storage optimization
- Robust validation during decompression

## Project Structure
- index.html – User interface
